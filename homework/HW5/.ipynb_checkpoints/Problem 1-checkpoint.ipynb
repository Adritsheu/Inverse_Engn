    "In this homework problem, you are going to use `tensorflow-probability` to deal with an unfair dice, i.e., a dice that has different probability of settling with each of the face 1 to 6 facing up, instead of the $p=1/6$ equal probability in the case of a fair dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with 5000 data entries of this dice. Each entry is a length-6 vector with one element being 1 and 0 for the rest. For example, $[0,1,0,0,0,0]$ means the \"2\" face of this dice landed facing up. This form is also the data form generated by `tfp.distribution.Bernoulli` when you feed multiple probability to it.\n",
